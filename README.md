This project is aimed to do MapReduce on the datasets by using MRjob.

The tasks are respectively as follows:

1. Given a csv dataset which contains the information of id numbers, titles, mixed genres of

under each movie genre.

2. Reverse the web-link graph

3. Given a dataset which contains samples which are from three iris species and have 
features for sepals and petals, implement KNN algorithm to classify those species-unknown Iris samples.
